# Adding a user to Launch and Places

To allow users to access places.adobe.com, they need to be added to Places Core Service in the Admin Console as a user. To allow users to have access to Launch, configure mobile properties, and use Places with the Adobe Experience Platform SDK, they need to be added to Adobe Experience Platform Launch in the Admin Console and be given the following permissions for Launch:

* All Property Rights:
  * Develop
  * Approve
  * Publish
  * Manage extensions
  * Manage environments
* Manage Properties permission under Company Rights 

If this is the first time you are adding a user, complete the following steps to add users to Launch and Places. If you have added users before, multiple profiles might be displayed, so ensure that you select the correct profile.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Only org administrators can access the Admin Console and add the users.

## 1. Verify that Places and Launch are provisioned 

To verify that Places and Launch are provisioned:

1. Log in to your Experience Cloud organization.
2. In the top-right side, click the Experience Cloud shell switcher.

3. Under **[!UICONTROL Platform]**, click **[!UICONTROL Administration]**.

   If you do not see **Administration** in the list, you are not an admin. You must contact your org admin to complete this procedure.

5. In the Admin Console, if you have access to several organizations, verify that the correct organization is selected in the top right side of the page. 

    This is the organization to which you will add your users. If the correct org has not been selected, click on the org, and select the org from the drop-down list. If you have access to several organizations, verify that the correct org is selected.
